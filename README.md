# Project Overview:

	This project describes an SIR-based co-infection model. The host dynamics 
	have been linked to the within-host dynamics through the transmission and infection
	dependent death rate. Within-host dynamics are described with Lotka-Volterra competition
	dynamics. 
	Variables values are defined in the script and linked between scripts. This means a change in a
 	withinHost_model variable value affects the host_model output, but can also affect the plot outputs.

## Scripts in this prject:

### Models:
	withinHost_model.py
	invasionAnalysis.py
	host_model.py
		
### Plotting of varying parameter values and effect on host population:
	plot_alphas.py
	plot_K.py
	cdelta_plot.py


# Software:
